# GoDNSWatch

`godnswatch` will start a dns server listening on the localhost. It will display a table of all the requests that are being made. This can be used for analysing the DNS traffic. We can also specify a DNS blacklist of known malware domain names. If a request is being made to a known malware, it will be flagged as MALWARE and it will be easier in conducting DNS based forensics of malware.
